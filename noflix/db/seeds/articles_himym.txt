 Two and a half years after How I Met Your Dad surprisingly did not get on the air, there is a new How I Met Your Mother spinoff in the works for next season, I have learned. Like How I Met Your Dad, I hear the new project, titled How I Met Your Father, is an ensemble show that tells the story from a female point of view.
 Deadline broke the news of the hybrid project, which is being written on spec for 20th Century Fox TV by This Is Us co-executive producers Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger. The script is yet to be taken out by the studio as it is still being written.
 Josh Radnor is rich and famous, and he's also got a huge deck that just got him sued. The "How I Met Your Mother" star owns a house in the Hollywood Hills. According to the lawsuit, the prior owner of Radnor's property had a right to extend his property to the neighbor's land, but only if he maintained a retaining wall and walkway.
 A How I Met Your Mother spin off is apparently in development, and the title is probably what you were expecting.
